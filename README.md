# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. We analyzed the Music reviews dataset to determine if there is any bias towards reviews written as part of the Vine program and if it makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.
